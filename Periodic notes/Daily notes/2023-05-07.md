# Agenda
Today [[Dad]] and I are going to the [[World of Golf]] to hit some golf balls. Dad has just received his new golf clubs. 
Then we are going to pickup [[Mom]] and [[Lilly]] and go eat lunch at [[Villa bel Parc]].

# Notes
[[Dad]]'s new golf clubs were excellent. I could hit farther and straighter with them than with my own. He hinted that it might be a good birtday present next year. 
Instead of [[Villa bel Parc]] we headed down to [[Klasse Salomons Celbrot]] and [[Miriam Salomons Celbrot]] and look at their new house. And [[Lilly]] and [[Chaplin]] could play. Their house was really nice with a great big kitchen. 
[[Mom]] and [[Dad]] hinted that they might be intereseted in buying [[Carolina Lindblom]] and [[Niklas Lindblom]]'s house if they get to take over [[Anders Lindahl]] 's house. But I am not to discuss that with the others since it is not clear yet. 
[[Miriam Salomons Celbrot]] recommended that we visit HÃ¶rdalen to walk

# Synopsis
A man wakes up, not knowing who he is surrounded by medical robotic arms. 
Slowly through flashbacks he remembers that the sun seems to be dying. He realizes he is on a space ship. In another solar system. 
A new invasive species has entered our solar system. It is essentially a space-faring amoeba, dubbed Astro-phage, with incredible properties. It can survive the surface of the sun, and moves on a single line between the sun and venus. It also seems to be causing some serious damage to the sun, making it dimmer. This threatens to cause a rapid ice age. All societies on Earth, therefore, pools all their resources into solving this problem. Everywhere they look they find astro-phage and the identified stars suffer the same fate. Eventually they find out that a star system where the astro-phage lives but the star is not dying.  They also find out that astro-phage can be used as  incredible rocket fuel. 
The protagonist is sent to the solar system and is the sole survivor of the crew. Once there he finds that another space faring alien is already there in their own ship that seems to have vastly different technological capabilities. It turns out he is also the sole survivor of his crew. And they were also sent here to investigate why this particular star seem immune to the influence of the astro-phage. They form a bond and you get to follow their development of a relationship. The alien race is blind and communicate a lot via melodic sounds. You get to experience how this different world-view might affect an intelligent race not to understand some "basic" and advanced physical concepts humans think would be fundamental to figure out space travel while at the same time they are much better at other sceintific methods and concepts than humans, such as engineering. They have to work together to solve the impending common crisis. 


# Overall impressions
Very similar to [[The Martian]]. It's funny, witty and makes you feel smart since much of it is written with a foundation in science. It is very entertaining but not profoundly intelligent. Highly recommend as entertainment but not to gain new insights. #would-read-again. 
The Martian is more realistic and I would recommend reading that first. Some concepts like using the astro-phage as rocket fuel is almost too silly, but I understand why it is necessary. I would, however, rate Hail mary higher in terms of entertainment. 

# Key concepts
It is a very interesting view on how the different ways of experiencing the world shape how we think and act. How would an intelligent but blind race of aliens go about developing space travel? Why would they? They would not look up into the night sky wondering what's out there.

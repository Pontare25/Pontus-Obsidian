Several small structures are appearing around the sun. Nations blame eachother for espionage but none can find evidence of secret rocket launches. 

Meanwhile something strange is happening on [[Jupiter]]. The launches do not originate from earth but seems to come from the mineral rich planet. Could the Russians or the Chinese have beaten the west in the next-era space-race? Without aiming for the red desert planet named after the roman god of war - [[Mars]]?

Months go by. The rate at which objects appear around the sun seem to be growing exponentially. 
There is now noticable activity on [[Jupiter]]. The objects surrounding the star appear to be highly reflective, aiming the solar output away from earth and instead toward the active areas on [[Jupiter]]. 
The decrease in the sun's luminosity have the science community speculating the impact on the global climate. Could this be divine intervention to help humanity fight its most dire and self-inflicted crisis?

Fanatic cults spring up all across the world worshipping the various tech billionairs regardless of how much they deny their involvement in solving the environmental crisis. But surely the world's elite must have banded together operate in the shadows to hoodwink and by-pass the international agreements for space launches in the name of saving humanity from itself? And to avoid further suspicion they have made the process self-sufficient and ever growing. 

Earth's climate is cooling. The climate crisis seem all but under control; returning to manageable levels. 

The scientific community begin to raise some concerns for the sustainability of the current development. Earth is cooling, FAST! As more and more of the reflectors aim away from earth and instead point directly towards [[Jupiter]]. 
The military factions also growing anxious. What if whoever controls the reflectors decide to point them at strategic targets on earth. It would be like a child focusing a magnifying glass on an ant. But instead of an ant it could be a town, a city, a country...

It is now getting colder and colder. As a result crops start to fail. Energy costs skyrocket. People are starving as never before. 

Governments plead openly that whoever is controlling this swarm of reflectors to start reflecting the sunlight back towards key areas of the earth. 
But there is no change. The reflective swarm continues to grow and the direction remains aimed at [[Jupiter]]. 

With no response, the governments decide to launch an assault directly at the swarm. A small direct hit meant to be a warning if the people in power do not take them seriously. But the process does not seem to stop. No one speaks up that they will make the necessary adjustments. The reflectors are simply replaced. 

[[Jupiter]] is in rough shape. Much of the planet is in fact dismantled. 

The  surface of the sun is now almost covered. This seems to trigger a new phase for the reflectors are now aimed outwards. 


# Concepts
## Civilization measure
The measure of a civilization is the sum of its total energy output. On [[The Kardishev scale]] humanity is a type 0.6-0.7 civilization. Where a type 1 is able to harness the total energy output of it's home planet. A type 2 the energy output of a star. A type 3 the energy output of a galaxy. 

## Humanity and earth does not even register as a concern 
An alien race so beyond humanity, so beyond type 1 and 2 civilizations that they are only interested in harnessing the energy output of stars that Earth, and much less humanity is even a concern to them.
